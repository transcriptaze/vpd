# FAQ

1. Shouldn't _centre_ be spelled _center_?

   What?!? No!! You _heathen_ ... sheesh! See also _colour_ and _through_ ... 


2. What happens if I specify a text location relative to two horizontal guides?

   Nothing. Well, technically you consign your text to the ninth level of hell, annoy Cthulhu and possibly [_break the Internet_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2FMqtC1x9Y), but other than that nothing.


3. Why can't I do _X_?

   _"Because it's wrong!"_ - [_BTVS_](https://youtu.be/QrluNqSjoHg?si=z_XZRsL5lh8OuUj7&t=29).
